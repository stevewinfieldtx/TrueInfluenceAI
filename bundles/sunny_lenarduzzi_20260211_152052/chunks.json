    "text": "I'm about to say something that might feel like a punch in the gut. Traditional online courses are over. If your plan is to record videos, upload them to a platform, and just magically make money, you're playing a bit of a losing game. And I say that as someone who's built courses just like that, very successfully, but I shut them all down years ago, and I've spent the last seven years building a different approach to online education that's now helped thousands of people turn their skills, their expertise, into scalable businesses. So I'm going to break down that model in this video and how you can apply it for yourself. Because yes, the space has changed. It's not quite a death, but it is an evolution. And you either will adapt or lose. Here's the thing. Who is the number one teacher in the world at this point? AI. AI can teach you information better, faster, and for free. Not to mention platforms like YouTube as well. There is a plethora of information we are drowning in. Just last year, there were over 2.5 billion prompts per day on Chachi B.T. And that is double the volume that they saw in 2024. But here's the part most people are missing. For a long time, courses worked because information was scarce. If you knew something that other people didn't, then you could package back, and you could sell it. That's a course. But now that has completely changed, because we've never had this much supply of information and free information in our life. We are overwhelmed with instant access. You could also say we're overwhelmed with instant info. And that's why it's become harder to sell a traditional course. Not because people don't want results. It's because they don't feel or see the value in just strictly information packaged. And I'm not saying you're saying that AI is the enemy. Love AI. Use it. Have tools built around it. And I'm not saying free information is the problem. In fact, I would actually argue that those avenues have made the new way to do online education that much more valuable. And I'm going to get into why and exactly how to execute on it in a second. If you're really serious about this, we put together the knowledge bank business plan that can take the skills, the expertise in your head, and help you with a step-by-step process of turning it into an online education business in this new model. So comment, knowledge bank below. It will send you the guide to access it on demand. So here's the big difference. There are now so many ways to learn information. And AI and YouTube great places to teach information. But humans create transformation. That is the difference. And that's where the real opportunity is now. And we've been teaching it for seven years, two thousands of people to turn their skills and their expertise into these scalable businesses.",

And we've been teaching it for seven years, two thousands of people to turn their skills and their expertise into these scalable businesses. The people that are going to win moving forward, they're not just selling these traditional recorded packaged programs. They're selling something that cannot be replaced. And it's really a combination of the best of all worlds. So let me break it down. But before we get into the model and the old way of doing things versus the new way of doing things, I just want to mention there are certain things that cannot be replaced. And that's why I'm saying this information age that we're living in, it is making actual wisdom that much more valuable. So the things that cannot be replaced and that you actually want to lean into are things like your hard earned wisdom and expertise through hands-on experience. The surprising challenges and struggles of achieving an outcome that you wouldn't know how to navigate if you've never done it. True accountability, human to human accountability, and also connectivity and community. Peer-to-peer learning, human connection, being able to talk to a real person, those things cannot be replaced. That's why the way forward is to build a truly human experience that aligns with your program materials to truly create this effective change for your clients and your members. So there really are sort of four camps of kind of the old models in online education. And listen, some of these still work okay. And some of them have benefits. But if you can find a way to combine them, which is what I'm going to share with you in a minute, that's where the real magic happens. So let's go through these old way models first. So let me lay these out. So it starts with one-to-one, which you're probably familiar with. That just means one-to-one consulting, one-to-one coaching. So you're doing everything in a silo. It can be really effective. Obviously, because it's nice to be able to customize to each person that you're working with completely. But you run into the similar trap that generally you're trying to avoid when you're starting a business, which is it's not scalable, because you are completely capped by the hours in the day. Okay, so then you have membership. So membership models are wonderful, and they can work really well. But your biggest pain point is going to be retention. And membership models require you to constantly be innovating in terms of the content you create, the programming that you're making available, all those extra pieces of the puzzle. And also it tends to kill profitability and cash flow because you're getting small incremental payments over time as opposed to a large influx of cash upfront. So it's just a model that takes a lot of",

And also it tends to kill profitability and cash flow because you're getting small incremental payments over time as opposed to a large influx of cash upfront. So it's just a model that takes a lot of admin, a lot of care, and how you structure it, and a whole lot of your time and attention to really make it successful and most importantly, transformative for the people who are in it. Number three is a traditional course. So I talked about this. That is simply your course videos. You put it in a platform and hope that somebody someday is going to buy it. So that is something that with the influx of information that we're all dealing with on a daily basis, people just don't find them as desirable anymore because they can mostly learn what they need to learn for free on the internet. Actually recently just heard a friend of mine, her mom is a therapist and she has lost about 10 clients because they've been going to chat GPT for their therapy instead of going to sessions. That sounds nuts, but this is just the nature of the beast right now. That's not the most reliable source, but people are finding other ways to get their access to information. Number four is the cohort model and this can be really effective because people can go through all at the same time. It creates this incredible energy and accountability. But again, it requires your time and attention for a set period. It's not necessarily the most scalable model because it has confines and constraints on it. And also the biggest challenge with cohorts is that you tend to get people in and excited and they're all ready for the start date. But the nature of people is they're not all going to do it at the same pace. So then you have people who feel left behind. They feel like they're failing. They feel like they're not as successful as everybody else and they give up and quit and they don't have any ongoing access to support or to a container where they could do it at their pace that makes more sense for them. It's a very structured situation where you're doing it maybe over the span of like two months and that makes it really hard for people to get what they need out of it if they're not as accountable as everybody else. So then let's shift into the new way which kind of takes the best aspects of all of these pieces and combines them into one. And this is also, like I said, from my own experience of working in the online education space for over a decade now, almost 15 years, which makes me feel old. But I didn't do this long time and I've tried many different models. So I was able to really come to",

But I didn't do this long time and I've tried many different models. So I was able to really come to a place where I realized, oh, this is where people tend to get the most out of it and they get the best results with this combination. So it's a 3C model, we call it, but there's also another thing that I'm going to add in here in a second. So it starts with your curriculum. You have to be able to extract from your skill set, from your expertise, an actual methodology. This is where most people screw up, go wrong and end up in the one-to-one rabbit hole of constantly chasing down one-on-one clients and getting capped by their time. The sacrifice, which is actually a massive benefit of creating a model that is scalable is you have to be very, very, very dialed in and specific to the outcome that you are going to create for your clients because you only want to work with clients who want that specific outcome. You cannot teach everything never on. So an example of that would be you try and create a program on business. You're going to get the flower shop owner, you're going to get an online coach, you're going to get the cleaning company, you're going to get everybody under the sun. And there are different nuances to how you grow each of those businesses. So instead, as an example, one of our clients teaches people how to create profitable cleaning businesses and they have absolutely nailed that niche and they've scaled to over $100,000 a month by being so focused and specific and their clients get great results. So methodology comes first. We call it the zero-tierow transformation. From your expertise, how can you take somebody from where they're most challenged to where they most want to be? That's your curriculum. From there, you have coaching, but it's not one-on-one coaching, although it feels like that a lot of the time because you're able to speak to people one-to-one on a Zoom call, for example, but there just happens to be a community of folks that are in the same spot as that person who are able to listen in. So you're having these one-on-one conversations just in a group setting. So we call that coaching at scale because what it does is it accelerates growth because there's many people on those calls that have the exact same question who are either too afraid to ask or they haven't even thought of the question yet. And then when somebody else asks it, they go, oh my gosh, that unlocked and now I'm going to accelerate forward. The third part of it is community, which I will say is the most magical part about these kinds of",

The third part of it is community, which I will say is the most magical part about these kinds of programs and everybody that we work with, they say their community is their favorite thing. Because it's where members are able to cheer each other on. They hold each other accountable. We've had members in our community get married, meet and get married. Okay, actually multiple. So it's really just an incredible human connection. So between the coaching and the community, there is a massive human element involved. There's accountability involved and there's forward momentum because of the group setting and everybody accelerating their learning by learning from one another. So if you're serious about turning your skills, your expertise, your knowledge into a scalable program in this model, be sure to comment knowledge bank below this video. We'll send you the link to access the guide on demand. But here's what's really interesting about this. All of this, this entire model is predicated on the most important part, which is going to sound very familiar. And it is the cohort. The cohort has to come first. So this is what we call your profitable offer prototype. And what that means is that you start with a version of your methodology, your curriculum, that is not built. And the key here is that you actually are going to sell before it's built. Why do you do this? Well, let me tell you a little story. We had a client who spent two years building his program, okay? Two years. In complete isolation, doing so much research, thinking it was going to be incredible. And in this case, this is what we call the curse of the expert. If you know something really well inside now, your tendency and the mistake you're going to make is you're going to brain dump it all into a program. What does that do? What did we talk about as the problem at the beginning of this video? It's just more information. That's the last thing people are looking for. Right now, particularly, people are interested in getting the outcome they're looking for as efficiently as possible. So this person spent two years watched the program that he had built and to end looked beautiful and no one bought. Okay? Then he applied our model and he's now scaled to 10 million in four years. Okay, so massive difference. The reality is if you build an isolation, you're most likely going to hear crickets when you try to launch a program because you haven't got any validation or proof that people want it. So we kind of flipped the whole process on its head. And because I come from a journalism background, I like the process of interviewing people. And I think you can learn",

And because I come from a journalism background, I like the process of interviewing people. And I think you can learn something from everybody you speak to. So the process that we go through is you're not selling necessarily off the bat. But what you are doing is you're building an audience from scratch. And you're building an audience from day one in the most efficient manner. Okay? Because most people try to build a massive audience and then hope that something will sell or they build a course in isolation for years and then it doesn't sell because there's no audience to buy. So we're kind of combining those and doing it at the same time. So the process looks like this. You identify, okay, what do I want my outcome to be for my program? Great. That's the starting point. Then you identify where is the person out when they're in the most pain and they want to get out of that and get to the outcome. Wonderful. We now have our starting point for our curriculum and our ending point for our curriculum. We know exactly the path you want to take them on to get there. That becomes your curriculum and your methodology. You lay that outline out. We cover week for six to eight weeks. Every week you teach live. Now how do you get the clients in there? So before you go ahead and teach that live and you're getting real world feedback and you're iterating on the fly which you will find very valuable because the amount of people who have done this process and said, I was going to build this in an entirely different way and I would have wasted so much time so glad I did it this way is a sounding. Okay? So you got to go in and be ready for feedback. So you can make it the best it can be for when you do scale it. The process of getting your clients is quite simple. It's a process of interviewing people who are a match for that ideal client who is at that challenge stage. And where do these people come from? A lot of our clients are not even on or using social media. They're using things like forums. They're using things like their offline network. They're using things like their peer group. They're using things like their friends and family and then they're asking, do you know anybody who is struggling with this and you be shocked when you start asking that question? How many people are going to kind of show up and say, yeah, I do or I am? So you just start the process of interviewing people.

What are you looking for in a solution? If you could wave a magic wand and achieve this result or this outcome, what would need to happen? They're giving you exactly what they need, what they want and what needs to be included in the curriculum. So you have that line and then you take that feedback and you start to plug it in where it's necessary. So you just start the whole process with an outline. Once you have your interviews done, you also then have a pipeline of potential buyers. And after every interview you say, do you happen to know anybody who's struggling with this? Right, they refer somebody else. Some cases they refer five, 10 people. Wonderful. You start to build out this client pipeline of ideal clients without having to be marketing all the time. So when you do that, once you do the interviews, then come back and on those calls, you can also say, I'm going to build something to solve this problem. Do you want to hear about it when I make it? And you better believe everybody says, yes, please, because if somebody has a problem, what do they want? They want a solution. And you know what? They want more than that. They want to know there's someone out there who actually took the time to listen to them, cares about them, and is built trust with them, because that's who they want to work with. So most of the time these interviews turn into your entire first cohort, not through posting a bunch of reels on Instagram, doing a bunch of TikTok dances. It's really quite simple. And I know it all sounds too simple. It's probably breaking your brain a little bit. But we've watched this happen every single day. We actually just had somebody generate the majority of her interviews through simply posting one targeted Facebook group. She didn't know anybody in there. She shared her story, her experience, and helping people solve this problem. And she was inundated with interviews. Okay? So consider that. So then you have your whole process. You do the interviews. You go back to those people, you say, hey, I built the thing that you need. Wonderful. And then you deliver your first cohort. You get incredible results. You build the base of a phenomenal community. Because everybody's in there together doing it live for the first time. There's such an energy about it. You start to see the little winds happen.

And then those people have access to that program. And the material once it's pre-recorded. So they can continue to go through it and get that support. And have access to the coaching calls. And have access to the community. And then you can set the timeframe for how long you want that to be. But it's not like you're cutting them off after the cohort happens. So they get the best of all worlds. And that's why the model has been so effective and so efficient for so many of our clients. So we're online courses dead. No, because nothing really ever dies. They just evolved. And that's what's happening. So we're seeing an evolution in online education. But again, we've been teaching this model for seven years. And we have so many people who have done it successfully over the years and built these incredible businesses in this way that allow them to detach all their time from their income. So they can free up their time but make a massive impact outside of let's say just their local area or outside of what their a calendar is going to allow them to do. From doctors to dancers to lawyers to everything in between. So no, online courses are not dead but they are evolving. And online education is booming. If you look at the stats, it's just continuing to grow. In fact, it's set to hit over a trillion dollars by 2032. So there is absolutely demand, especially since 2020. People are going online to learn and to create transformation in a more efficient way. Also, we're seeing that some people are, you know, turning to online programs as opposed to traditional education models like University and College. So there are so many different applications of online education and there's so many ways to do it. But what we have found in doing this for so long and with so many different people is that having a hybrid approach and having this sort of new way methodology and model of doing it is the way to combine the human expertise that cannot be replaced with the advances that we're seeing in technology. It's just the reality of kind of where we're out of this point. I started on YouTube when nobody was talking about social media. I think there were three other channels.
